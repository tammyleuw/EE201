## About Me 

Hello and welcome to my GitHub! I’m an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the University of Washington - Seattle. I’m passionate about growth, multitasking, and exploring the intersection of business and technology. My goal is to leverage my technical skills to create sustainable projects and drive positive change both locally and globally. I’m dedicated to learning, leading, and making a meaningful impact through my work.

##  K-12 Tech. Experience...
My journey into tech began in elementary school when I started experimenting with HTML to customize personal websites related to my favorite games. In middle school, I joined the Technology Student Association (TSA), where I worked with 3D printing and engraving machines, soldered electronics, and built a CO2 dragster as my first major project. I continued to explore tech by creating and customizing websites in my spare time.

During high school, I was involved in robotics for two out of three years and took AP Computer Science courses during my junior and senior years. To further my skills, I also completed Python courses over the summer.

##  College Experience...
In college, I initially joined the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and participated in several other clubs. I’ve worked on various projects, including developing multiple graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java, such as solitaire and tic-tac-toe games. My coursework and projects have deepened my understanding of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and I continue to explore new technologies and applications.
